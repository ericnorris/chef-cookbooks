The following methods are available:

    Commentify takes the string in `comment` and wraps it appropriately
    for being a comment. By default it'll comment it ruby-style (leading "# ")
    with a width of 80 chars, but the arg hash can specify `start`, `finish`,
    and `width` to adjust it's behavior.
